# About

PyPlane is a free software for phase plane analysis of second order dynamical
systems written for PYTHON 3.8 and PyQT5 (compare MATLAB's
[pplane](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/61636-pplane)). It
is published under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.

## Features:

* Vector fields and streamlines for second order nonlinear dynamical systems of
  the form x'=f(x,y), y'=g(x,y)
* Forward and backward solution trajectories for arbitrary initial conditions in
  the phase plane
* Time dependent solutions x(t) and y(t)
* 3D visualization t(x,y)
* Nullclines
* Find equilibrium points and calculate the corresponding Jacobian
* Linearize a system around equilibrium points, characterize and plot
  eigenvectors
* Add arbitrary function into the phase plane area (i.e. contour lines of
  Ljapunov-functions)
* An optionally installed and accessible LaTeX/dvipng environment produces much
  prettier results in the linearization tabs. If no LaTeX is installed, the
  program is still fully functional.
* Several example systems are shipped with PyPlane. You find them in the
  directory `library`. Load them via "Open - From File" or by pressing STRG+O

**Please don't hesitate to report bugs, comments, or suggestions!**

# Running PyPlane

PyPlane runs either natively in a fully functional Python environment under
Linux/ Windows/ OSX or as a stand-alone executable under MS Windows.

## Running natively under Python

### Installation using pip

If you have `pip` available in your Python installation PyPlane can be easily
installed as follows:

1. Clone the repository
2. Change into the root directory of the repository
3. Execute `pip install .`

PyPlane can then be invoked from the command line by executing the command
`pyplane` or via `python -m pyplane`

*Note:* When some important missing features are implemented PyPlane will be
also available via PyPi.

### Executing from the source code

If the following pre-requisites are fullfilled you may invoke PyPlane directly
from the repository:

**Pre-requisites:**

* Python 3.8
* NumPy (tested under version 1.20)
* SciPy (tested under version 1.6)
* Matplotlib (tested under version 3.3)
* SymPy (tested under version 1.7)
* PyQt5 (tested under version 5.13)

**Launch of pylane**

1. Clone the repository
2. Change into the root directory of the repository
3. Execute `python run_pyplane.py` or `python -m pyplane`

## Running as a standalone program (Windows only)

If you do not have Python available on Windows you can use the
[stand-alone version](https://github.com/TUD-RST/pyplane/releases). You just
need to run the provided installer file `PyPlane_Setup.exe`. It will create a
directory on your desktop in which all required files will be stored. A shortcut
for launching PyPlane will be placed on the desktop. No modifications in the
system registry will be done. As in the native Python version, a functional
LaTeX installation will produce better formatting results in the linearization
tabs. However, even without LaTeX the program is fully functional.

Double-click on the PyPlane icon on the desktop in order to launch the
application. **Start-up may take some time.**

# Python 2

The last version of this program which is fully compatible with Python 2.7
is [version 1.1](https://github.com/TUD-RST/pyplane/releases/tag/PyPlane_v1.1.0)
.
