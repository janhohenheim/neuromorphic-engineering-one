Instructions for building the Windows executable using PyInstaller 4.3 on
Python 3.8.8

1. Make sure PyInstaller 4.3 is installed in a Python virtual environment which
   does only contain the packages required by PyPlane.

2. Make sure that build_dir in build_windows_exe.py is not opened in any
   application or console, i.e., it can be deleted by the script.
   
3. Run build_windows_exe.py from the Python virtual environment mentioned in 1.

4. The resulting exe should be found in build_dir\PyPlane.

5. If some modules are not found after launching the exe you have to manually
   import them using the hidden-import option in PyPlane.spec. This can be
   a time-consuming trial and error procedure.
   
6. Open the file InstallerPyPlane.nsi, adjust the version information
   (if required), and run the file through NullSoft Installable System.
   Setup.exe will be placed into build_dir.
